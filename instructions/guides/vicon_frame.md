## Coordinate Frame 
The ROB498_Drone object in the Vicon system has its coordinate frame defined as in the images below. The x axis (red) is down the length of your drone body, the z axis is upward, and the y axis (green) forms a right-handed coordinate frame with the other two axes. 

## Transform to Drone 
The exact transform between the marker and your droneâ€™s coordinate frame will depend on what you use as your base frame (by default the centre of the cube) and where your cube is located relative to the marker. This is something you will have to either measure or find through some calibration method.
