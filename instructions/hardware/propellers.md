# Propellers 101

A variety of propeller sizes will fit your drone, with blade diameters between 5" and 6". A brief review of propeller specifications and available choices is provided below.

## Propeller Specifications

The numbers that are most important are diameter and pitch; a reasonable text/video tutorial is available [here](https://dronesgator.com/drone-propeller-terms-and-numbers/).

## Recommended Propeller Choices

We recommend three-blade, 5" propellers with a pitch of 4" (ish). Possible choices include [these Gemfan Hurricane props](https://rotorgeeks.com/props/5-inch/gemfan-hurricane-mck-51466-v2-3-blade) that we have purchased for the course. However, other 5" units should also work, with pitch from 3.5"-4" and with an M5 centre hole diameter (to fit the drone motor shafts).
## Larger-Diameter Propellers

We do not recommend 6" propellers for your drone. They will work, but the clearance between the edge of the propeller and the frame is limited.
