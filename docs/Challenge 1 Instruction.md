# Challenge 1: Drone "Run Up" Detailed Instruction
As has introduced in the Lecture 2 slides, the drone hardware (HW) kits are assigned to each team. The kit will be only prepared with soldering work compeleted,
and the task for the teams is to assemble the drone and pass the "run up" to prove that your aircraft is **air-worthy**. During the "run up" demo,
the teams should follow and pass all the checklist items (>https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/299314) and interviewed by TAs, to show that they have **fully understood** all the safety guidelines
and pre-flight / postflight procedures.

This manual will help you get started with the brief steps of assembling and configuring a drone. For complete and detailed instructions, please find in the PX4 autopilot 
official documentation (>https://docs.px4.io/main/en/)

## Hardware Setup
Within the kit you will find that the power distribution board is already soldered, but the avionics still should be connected-up first.
